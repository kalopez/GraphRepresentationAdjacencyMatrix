GraphRepresentationAdjacencyMatrix 
============================
Description:

This program prints the nodes that are adjacent to each vertex. The graph is represented using an adjacency matrix. 
Adjacency matrixes are best for graphs that are dense or for whom the number of edges is similar to the number 
of vertices. Otherwise, it can result in a lot of wasted space. 

Space complexity is O(V^2) where V is number of vertices. 
Time Complexity is O(V) where V is number of vertices.

It can also find all the vertices that are connected to a vertex, as well as,  if two vertices in the graph are connected.
