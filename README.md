GraphRepresentationAdjacencyMatrix 
============================
Description:

This program prints the nodes that are adjacent to each vertex. The graph is represented using an adjacency matrix. 
Adjacency Matrixes are best for graphs that are dense or for whom the number of edges is similar to the number 
of vertices. Otherwise, it can result in a lot of wasted space. The advantage of using an Adjacency Matrix is that time complexity for finding adjacent vertices 
and connections between vertices is improved compared to other methods.

This program can also find all the vertices that are connected to a vertex, as well as if two vertices in the graph are connected.

Space complexity is O(V^2) where V is number of vertices. 
Time complexity for printing out matrix is O(V^2), for finding all connected nodes is O(v) and for finding if two nodes are connected is O(1).
