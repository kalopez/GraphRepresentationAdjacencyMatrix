GraphRepresentationAdjacencyMatrix 
============================
Description:

This program prints the nodes that are adjacent to each vertex. The graph is represented using an adjacency matrix. 
Adjacency matrixes are best for graphs that are dense or for whom the number of edges is similar to the number 
of vertices. Otherwise, it can result in a lot of wasted space. 

Space complexity is O(V^2) where V is number of vertices. 
Time Complexity is O(V) where V is number of vertices.

Later on, additional functionality such as finding if two nodes are connected or being able to pass in a list of nodes
and edges might be added to the program.
